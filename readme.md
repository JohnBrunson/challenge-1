# Challenge 1

## Description
Motivation for doing this was to play a kind of sort of version of "code golf" How many lines less can I make this CSS? How much "drier" (Don't Repeat Yourself) can I make the code? as it relates to CSS. This is the initial attempt. Feature branch is adding this readme and implementing the suggestion.  The importance of making the code drier is to make maintaining this much easier and less brittle. The less code there is, the less there is to go wrong.

The learning experience here was just how little CSS could be written to do all the same things. I'll probably update this with a feature branch to fix the one suggestion I had during a code review. That and getting a chance to play with github more. :-)

## Installation

No installation. The point of this is to look at the CSS. For that reason, I've included an annotated version so that it's easy to see what was given, what my changes were, and what my thought process was. There's not a lot as at the root this is a very simple project.

## Credits

Michael Seaman for feedback on my CSS consolidation. Full disclosure: He suggested (but did not write) consolidating the three classes (benefit-lead, benefit-brand, benefit-cost) into one class and thus making it easier. I expect that you may be able to do something similar with the search engine classes, but I think as it stands, the code makes more sense as is. (If I change my mind, I may modify it later.)
